# dsa-refresh

A small collection of data structures and algorithms implementations for practice and interview preparation.

Languages included
- Python
- Go (in `golang/`)

Project structure
- `python/` — implementations and small runners for common data structures (stack, queue, singly/doubly linked lists)
- `golang/` — Go implementations (examples and exercises)

Quick start (Python)
1. Change to the `python` folder:

```bash
cd "dsa-refresh"/python
```

2. Run the main example (requires Python 3):

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Notes
- Use the individual modules in `python/` to test or import specific data structures in your own scripts.
- Feel free to expand examples or add tests.

If you'd like, I can add tests, example outputs, or a short guide for solving each problem.
